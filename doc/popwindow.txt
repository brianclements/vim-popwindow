INTRODUCTION                                      *popwindow* *popwindow.vim*
PopWindow is a workflow plugin that allows one to easily close windows based on
pre-defined criteria, in the order they please, and wherever that window might
be located on their current tab so that they don't have to futz with getting
their cursor in the correct window before closing it. This criteria is based on
things like filename, buftype, filetype, and readonly status.

This plugin was made for plugins and helper functions that frequently pop-up
docs, command output, or other temporary windows. Now they can be closed just as
easily as they arrived.

Built-in types include:

* fugitive
    * So far, just the `:Gstatus` window
* help
    * The standard vim help window
* quickfix
* temp
    * a more general category that includes the 'nofile' and 'nowrite' buftypes,
      and files with no filename and no filetype
* nerdtree


CONFIGURATION                                     *popwindow-configuration*
Set these in your |vimrc|. Default values are shown below.

g:popwindow_close_types                           *g:popwindow_close_types*
>
    let g:popwindow_close_types = ['fugitive', 'help', 'quickfix', 'temp', 'nerdtree']
<

On invocation of the plugin, the setting above will close 'fugitive' windows
first. On next invocation, it will close the 'help' windows next, and so on.
One closure will occur upon each invocation.

Include the types you want in this setting, omit the ones you don't, and set
the order you desire. If applicable, each type has it's own criteria and
special instructions for matching and closing the window of that type so that
they are handled properly; 'nerdtree' is closed with `NERDTreeClose` and
'quickfix' is closed with `ccl` for example.

g:popwindow_close_method                          *g:popwindow_close_method*
>
    let g:popwindow_close_method = 'buffer' 
<

You can select whether to close the buffer itself or just the window by setting 
either 'buffer' or 'window'.

g:popwindow_zealous_close                         *g:popwindow_zealous_close*
>
    let g:popwindow_zealous_close = 0
<

For extreme cases of window proliferation, you can tell PopWindow to close all
instances of each window type upon invocation, not just one at a time.

Since all but the 'temp' window type typically produces only one window anyway,
you will only really notice this for 'temp' types.

g:popwindow_pop_normal                            *g:popwindow_pop_normal*
>
    let g:popwindow_pop_normal = 1
<

When these pre-defined types no longer exist on your tab, PopWindow will start
to close the window with the highest ID number (i.e. the bottom-most-right
window).

g:popwindow_ignore_modified_buffers      *g:popwindow_ignore_modified_buffers*
>
    let g:popwindow_ignore_modified_buffers = 1
<

We can tell PopWindow to ignore buffers that have been modified and close them
anyway. This setting is relatively safe because modifying buffers doesn't
change the criteria upon with we decide to close a window, but caution should
still be used when using with |g:popwindow_zealous_close|.
