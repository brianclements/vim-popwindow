# Roadmap

## Version 1.1.0
* Add functionality to detect if current buffer is open in another window in any
  tab. If not, do `bdelete` on buffer when popping normal buffer windows. If
  buffer is open elsewhere, just do a close window.

## Version 1.2.0
* Add configuration settings for some of these aggressiveness options when
  closing windows.
