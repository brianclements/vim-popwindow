# Fixme

* Currently closes nerd tree first before other temp windows. Change to ignore
  NERD tree entirely and not include it in it's calculus.

* When multiple windows of same type are present, the first one is closed
  (because we search the list forward). It should be the reverse (possibly by
  searching backward?)
